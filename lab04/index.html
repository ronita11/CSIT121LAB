    <p>Ingredients:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>

        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>

        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>

        <li>1 tsp salt</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>

        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>

        <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>

    </ul>
</nav>
</main>

 

    <p>Instructions:</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>

        <li>Add the eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.</li>

        <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin; this is okay.</li>

        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>

        <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>

        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>This chocolate cake is my favorite because it's incredibly moist and has the perfect balance of chocolate flavor. It's a family recipe that's been passed down for generations.</p>
