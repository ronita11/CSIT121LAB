                                         <p>I really enjoy cooking.Because everyone enjoys eating wonderful food, it is said that good food is a good mood. I really like cooking traditional foods. I started cooking when I was around 10 years old, and I used to help my mother in the kitchen. The image below depicts a popular Nepalese dish known as "momo."It's called dumplings in English, but it's a Nepalese dumpling.. </p>
